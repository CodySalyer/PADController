### Contribution guidelines ###

Some general guidelines about creating code
The goal is to keep this as an object application.
All objects should be free from board specifics IE pin numbers 
C#: Create class definitions in an individual header file with a usefull namespace
C++: also use header files for class definitions

While  devloping your code please fork your project so your testing doesn't effect others.

### Who do I talk to? ###

If you have any questions please let me know if you're worried about breaking something i'd prefer if you ask sooner vs later.
